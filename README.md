# Yallakoora Match Details Scraper

## Description
This project involves developing a web scraping tool to extract match details from the Yallakoora website based on a user-input date. The tool fetches and processes match data, providing users with detailed information about the matches played on the specified date.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** For writing the main script and handling data processing.
- **BeautifulSoup:** For parsing HTML content and extracting the relevant information.
- **Selenium:** For automating browser interactions when necessary.
- **Requests:** For making HTTP requests to fetch the webpage content.
- **CSV:** For storing the extracted data in a structured format.

## Key Features
- **User Input:** The user can specify the date for which they want to scrape match details.
- **Automated Data Extraction:** The script navigates the Yallakoora website, searches for matches played on the specified date, and extracts detailed information about each match.
- **Data Storage:** The extracted information is saved into a CSV file for easy access and analysis.

## Challenges Overcome
- Handling dynamic web content that requires interaction with JavaScript elements.
- Ensuring that the extracted data is accurate and complete, given the variability in the website's structure.
- Implementing error handling to manage potential issues such as missing data or changes in the website layout.

## Outcome
The project successfully provided a reliable and efficient tool for gathering match details from the Yallakoora website based on user-input dates, which can be used for sports analysis or other purposes.
